# Win-to-Die

Win To Die is a 2-4 multiplayer survival racing game where the main goal is to finish the race last using different strategies and unique items. Players control an out-of-control Fisher-Price car as it rolls down a steep downward-sloping track. At the end of the track awaits their certain demise: a one kilometer-tall cliff leading to shark-infested waters.  Thus, the player who wins the race, loses in life (and in our game).
